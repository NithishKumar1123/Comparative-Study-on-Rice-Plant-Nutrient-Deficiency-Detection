# Comparative Study on Rice Plant Nutrient Deficiency Detection
This paper compares different approaches to detect rice plant nutrient deficiency using various deep learning algorithms. Various techniques have been implemented involving image preâ€“processing, data generation, and augmenting the dataset to train the model, test the model and compare them efficiently using various visualization techniques. Rice cultivation in hydroponic systems has the potential to change the agricultural sector. Growers may enhance their nutrient management methods, lower crop losses, and boost crop yields by utilizing technological advances and advancements such as sensors, IoT devices, computer vision, and machine learning.
